<h2>Work and Education</h2>

<p><bf>Masters of Science in Computer Science</bf> <i>University of Colorado - Boulder, Boulder, CO</i> Aug 2025 - (IP)</p>
<p><bf>Bachelor of Science in Computer Science</bf> <i>University of Wyoming, Laramie, WY</i> Aug 2021 - May 2025</p>
<p><bf>Bachelor of Science in Mathematics</bf> <i>University of Wyoming, Laramie, WY</i> Aug 2021 - May 2025</p>

<p><bf>Software Development Intern</bf> <i>L3Harris, Herndon, VA</i> May 2025 - Aug 2025<br>
<ul><li>Designed, implemented, and tested scripts to assist systems engineers in validating that safety requirements were correctly transitioned between systems.</li>
<li>Learned the importance of thorough planning from a systems engineering perspective. Put it into practice in products, including detailed documentation.</li>
</ul></p>

<p><bf>Student Researcher</bf> <i>University of Wyoming SURE Program, Laramie, WY</i> Jan 2025 - May 2025<br>
<ul><li>Worked under Dr. Andrew Kirby to research and write computational fluid dynamics software from scratch.</li>
<li>Researched, designed, and wrote a simple computational fluid dynamics software that simulates fluid flow over an airfoil. learned the physics and mathematics behind 
    fluid flow in order to better understand how to simulate it with a program. Compiled derivations and choices made for the application into a paper, then presented 
    the project at the University of Wyoming's 2025 Undergraduate Research and Inquiry Day with a 10 minute talk.</li></ul></p>

<p><bf>Software Development Intern</bf> <i>L3Harris, Herndon, VA</i> May 2024 - Aug 2024<br>
<ul><li>Assited in developing methods to save NITF file objects as a key-value pair data structure, which was new functionality for an image processing software used 
    in multiple industries. This included debugging and writing unit tests for each class, as well as updating and in some cases creating more comprehensive application tests.</li></ul></p>

<p><bf>Student Programmer</bf> <i>University of Wyoming Student Information Services, Laramie, WY</i> Aug 2023 - Dec 2024<br>
<ul><li>Updated query code for daily processes, some of which fixed code concerning student data. Assisted in migrating the university student portal to a new platform, 
    which involved database queries in SQL and basic Angular Javascript.</ul></p>
