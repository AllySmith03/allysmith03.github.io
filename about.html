<h2>About Me!</h2>

<p>Professional paragraph</p>

<p>I also really enjoy reading, music, art, and cooking. I am trying to get back into playing the violin and piano, and am always looking for new recipes!
   <br>During the winter, I love skiing, snowmobiling, and figure skating. During the summer, I enjoy climbing, hiking/backpacking, and .... 
   <br>This is my motorcycle, Mars! (Photo to come).
</p>

<p>More coming soon</p>
